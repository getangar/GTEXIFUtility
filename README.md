# GTEXIFUtility

Welcome to GTEXIFUtility! This project is a collection of small utilities to be used to manipulate photo files based on the content of their EXIF metadatas.
At the moment, the following tools are available:

- GTImageDateFix: this command line tool, takes as input the path of a directory, it scans the content looking for pictures and modifies the file creation date with the value of the EXIF tag "DateTimeOriginal"
- GTWebpImageConverter: this command line tool, takes as input the path of a directorz, it scans the content look for pictures of type "webp" and convert them in jpg

**Disclaimer:** these tools are provided as they are, without any warranty and you use them at your own risk.
